# Calculate Strength Benchmarks for Cyclists

Personal project to provide a simple and easy calculator of strength
benchmarks.

This is a simple calculator for the strength benchmarks put together
by Chad Timmerman for cyclists, depending on their discipline. The
values are provided in [a TrainerRoad blog
post](https://blog.trainerroad.com/coach-chads-strength-traini/ng-recommendations-for-cyclists/).
Use at your own risk; the author is neither a certified trainer nor a
medical professional, and put this together purely to make it easier
to calculate these values should the reader want to see them without
doing any math.

A dummy data file describing the benchmarks is included; of course
you can fill it in with the values from the blog post or your own
preferred values as appropriate.
